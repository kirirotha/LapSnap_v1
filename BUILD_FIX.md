# âœ… Fixed: Core API Build Issue

## Problem
The `shared/package.json` file was empty, causing npm to fail with:
```
JSONParseError: Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing empty string
```

## Solution
Created a proper `shared/package.json` with the necessary configuration.

## âœ… Status
- âœ… `shared/package.json` created
- âœ… `npm install` working
- âœ… `npm run build` successful

## Next Step: Start the Core API

Now you can run the backend API to enable RFID reader connectivity:

```bash
cd services/core-api
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
Core API Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

## Then: Connect to Your FX9500

1. Keep the backend running
2. Your frontend is already running on another terminal
3. Navigate to "Races" â†’ "Scan Test" tab in the browser
4. Click "Connect" to connect to your FX9500 at `169.254.1.1`
5. Click "Start Scanning" to read real RFID tags!

## Notes

The core-api was missing the RFID routes that were created earlier (they were undone). You'll need to:

1. Re-add the RFID service files if you want to use the real FX9500
2. Or keep using the simulated tags in the frontend for now

The build is now working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
